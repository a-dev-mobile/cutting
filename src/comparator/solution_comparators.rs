//! Solution comparator functions
//! 
//! This module contains Rust implementations of Java comparators used for
//! ranking and sorting solutions in the cut list optimization engine.
//! 
//! Each comparator function returns a `std::cmp::Ordering` which can be used
//! directly with Rust's sorting functions like `sort_by()` and `sort_by_key()`.
